# Systems2LinuxMalwareScanner
A final project for OSU CSE 2431 Systems 2. A linux malware scanner that contains a userspace program and kernel modules.

There are command line arguments that allows the user to manipulate kernel-space items.

Compile:
  gcc -o MalwareScanner MalwareScanner.c
  
Run:
  ./MalwareScanner

The inital menu will give the user 5 options, each representing different groups of functionality. 

(1) Will prompt the user with 4 options, described on the terminal. The user will be able to search for a specific process as well as kill a process by process ID.

(2) Allows the user to view the memory mapping of user-specified processes(2). Given this mapping, the user can then specify an address and print X number of memory words of that process (3).

(3) Allows the user to specify a process and scan the next system call that it makes (2).

(4) Allows the user to print the directory's contents (1) and alter the access of a file (2). The filepath needs to be <filename> if the document is located in the same directory as the file. If not, the filepath needs to be listed in its entirety. "../" goes back one level in the directory. It may be helpful to have a file system viewer open to help create the filepath.
